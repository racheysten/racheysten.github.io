## Frequently Ask Questions

Have more questions? Don't hesitate to contact us below!

* **What is Flock?**Flock is Fling's take on a frequent flyers program. Due to our limited flying radius, our tier requirements
								are lowered compared to our competitors' standards. This makes our offers hard to beat!
* **Do my miles reset at the end of the year?**Yes. Every 12 calendar months from the date of your first flight, your miles AND tier status
								will reset. Don't worry! Any unclaimed discount offers or raffle prizes will not reset until their individual
								expiration date.
* **How do I record/claim my miles?**If you purchase a ticket while logged into your account, your miles will automatically be accounted for. If you did not claim your miles at purchase or the miles are missing, you can
								request your miles under the "Claim" page.
* **How do I claim rewards?**Once a reward is ready to be claimed, simply press the "Claim" button next to it and follow the prompts.
* **Is Flock free?**Flock is 100% free to sign-up for! All we ask for is: your name, a valid email address, a username, and a password.
* **Do I have to sign-up for Flock?**No. Flock is an optional rewards program up to the consumer's discretion. We highly advise our customers
								to sign-up for the program to receive additional discounts. Nonetheless, even without Flock, Fling's price are still the lowest in the southeast.
